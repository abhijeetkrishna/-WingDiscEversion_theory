On cluster run array_get_mesh.sh to run array_get_mesh.py.

Here I use meshzoo to make a spherical mesh. Then from that mesh we rotate it and crop a spherical mesh. 

## Important required packages
Meshzoo and all related packages like optimesh, meshplex, meshio need to be upgraded to their latest version to run. The author of these packages says that the packages will become commercial at some time. Then it should be possible to generate icosasphere mesh some other way. 

## Folders
- pickle - pickle files which have the format of [balls, springs]
- vtk
